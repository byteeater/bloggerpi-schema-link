**Difference Between relatedLink and significantLink**

In a websiteâ€™s link structure, relatedLink and significantLink serve different purposes in connecting pages. Hereâ€™s how to use them correctly:

For Blog Posts and Articles:

âœ… relatedLink is used to indicate parent pages that are relevant.
âœ… significantLink is used for URLs that are highly relevant to the pageâ€™s context and content, typically matching the on-page links.

For Category Pages (Including E-commerce):

âœ… relatedLink is used to link to other parent category pages within the siteâ€™s hierarchy.
âœ… significantLink is used for products or pages directly related to the category.

Why the Distinction?

The difference comes down to semantics and relevance.

ðŸ”¹ The term "significant" carries a stronger meaning than "related", which is why URLs that are considered more important in relation to the source page should be marked as significantLink.

Understanding this distinction helps optimize internal linking structure, improving clarity for both users and search engines. ðŸš€
